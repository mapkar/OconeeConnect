        <h2>What is LoRa Radio?</h2>
        <p>LoRa (short for "Long Range") is a special kind of wireless radio technology designed for <strong>long-distance, low-power communication</strong>. It's perfect for situations where you need to send small amounts of data (like text messages or location pings) over miles without using much battery.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Key points for everyday understanding:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>It works like a super-efficient walkie-talkie signal, but for data instead of voice.</li>
                <li>Uses a smart trick called Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) — imagine sending signals that "chirp" across frequencies to punch through obstacles and go farther with very little power.</li>
                <li>Range: Up to several miles in open areas (even 10+ miles line-of-sight in ideal conditions), and it can work indoors or through trees/buildings better than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</li>
                <li>Low power: Devices can run on small batteries for days, weeks, or even years depending on use.</li>
                <li>No license needed in most places (uses free ISM radio bands like 915 MHz in the US).</li>
                <li>It's the physical radio layer — the "how the signal travels" part — not a full network by itself.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>LoRa was created by Semtech and powers tons of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, like smart sensors in farms, cities, or remote areas. But for personal use, it's amazing for off-grid texting and location sharing.</p>

        <h2>How Meshtastic Works (Simple Explanation for the Average Person)</h2>
        <p>Meshtastic is a free, open-source project that turns cheap LoRa radios into a <strong>decentralized, off-grid text messaging and location-sharing network</strong>. No cell service, no Wi-Fi, no internet required — just your phone and a small device.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Think of it like this:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>You buy or build a small LoRa radio device (like a Heltec, LilyGO, or RAK — usually $20–$50).</li>
                <li>You flash it with Meshtastic firmware (easy one-click tools on meshtastic.org).</li>
                <li>Pair it to your phone via Bluetooth using the free Meshtastic app (Android/iOS/web).</li>
                <li>Now you can send text messages, share GPS location, or even short data to other people with Meshtastic devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>The magic is the **mesh network**:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each device (called a "node") automatically relays messages it hears to others nearby.</li>
            <li>Your message hops from node to node until it reaches the person (or everyone in range).</li>
            <li>No central tower or router needed — it's peer-to-peer and decentralized.</li>
            <li>Messages retry a few times if needed, and the system avoids duplicates.</li>
            <li>Range extends with more nodes: One node might reach 5 miles; 10 nodes in a chain could cover 20–50+ miles in good conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>It's great for hiking groups, events, emergencies, rural areas, or just fun experimenting with off-grid comms. Your phone stays in your pocket — it just talks to the radio via Bluetooth, and the radio handles the long-range part.</p>
